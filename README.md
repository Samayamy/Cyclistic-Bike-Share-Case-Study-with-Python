## 🔍 Summary of Findings

✅ **Members vs Casuals:**  
- **Members:** 63% of total users.  
- **Casuals:** 37% of total users.

✅ **Average Duration:**  
- Casual riders average **about 24.9 minutes per ride**, nearly **double the member's average of 13–14 minutes**.  
- This suggests casual riders typically use bikes for **leisure or exploration**, while members predominantly take **quick, purposeful journeys** — likely commuting or running errands.

✅ **Monthly Trends:**  
- Casual riders’ average trip length **peaks during the summer months**, with **rides averaging 28 minutes in July**.  
- After this peak, their average drops in the fall and reaches a low in the winter.  
- In contrast, members’ ride lengths remain **more consistent year-round**, peaking at about 13 minutes in May and then declining slightly afterwards — reflecting their **dependable, utility-oriented usage**.

✅ **Daily Patterns:**  
- Casual riders predominantly use bikes **between 6 AM and 10 AM**, and usage **peaks at 5 PM**, likely for sightseeing or weekend leisure rides.  
- Members start riding much earlier — **between 4 AM and 9 AM** — reflecting their **morning commutes**, and usage again **peaks at 5 PM** as they return home.  
- Overall, members make up the **majority of rides at all hours**, indicating their **dependence on the service for daily travel**.

✅ **Bike Type:**  
- Electric bikes are the most frequently used by both groups.
